While on a recent vacation I decided I should contribute to some open-source projects. I resolved to do so as soon as I was able.
Here are some recent contributions.

## BG Mercs

Considerations:  
Sticking to the BG brand guidelines, encountered some difficulties with the fonts.
Not suitable for displaying numbers.

Considerations:  
My theory, if we get the display of the smart contract data right, 
we are free to do whatever we want with the rest of the UI - but the UI for people's money has to be legit.
Testing this theory, I created some artwork.   

<br/> <br/>
Fitting with the theme, I was inspired by a piece by Leonardo DaVinci. <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenario" target="_blank"><i>Profilo di Capitano Antico</i></a>
 <br/>
I made a quick illustration to see how it would fit with the UI.

Along with the Mercs site, I also created some artwork to plop in. The artwork is based on the vegetables in Mario 2.
